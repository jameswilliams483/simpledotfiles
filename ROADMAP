Features:
---------------
Update commnad
    If we added new config files to simpledotfiles, only add new files not already
 hard linked. 

Log Command:

Local Files:
    Ability to rename old file as <foo>.local and source that file in newly symlinked .rc file. Might not work for all dotfiles. 

Configuration:
---------------
LOCAL_PRECEDENCE = False
    If True, sourced .local files will take precedence over dotfile files

Details:
--------------- 
~/.simpledotfiles
- backups
- logs


Thrash:
---------------
Upgrade support:
-> mark simpledotfiles files as such and overwrite previous files if current dotfile is newer (this won't ever happen though because files are hardlinked)
